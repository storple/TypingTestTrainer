# TypingTestTrainer
Trying to make my first ever project with Python, a simple typing test that can measure how fast you can type.

Right now, this app works as a simple command-line typing test, but later I am planning to add a GUI with Tkinter to learn more about how GUIs work and other programming nuances that I need to know. In the future, I want to add alternative layout functionality, where you can emulate typing on an alternative layout such as Colemak or Dvorak within the app.
